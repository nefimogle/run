The game has three modes: Story Mode, where you follow the protagonist's quest to save his childhood friend from an evil organization; Arcade Mode, where you can play any stage with different difficulty levels; and Gallery Mode, where you can view the images of the girls you have stripped. The game also has a variety of weapons, power-ups, and bosses to challenge your skills.
 
Sentimental Shooting is not for everyone, as it contains nudity and sexual content. However, if you are looking for a fun and quirky game that pays homage to the classic shooters of the past, you might enjoy this hidden gem. You can download the game from various websites, such as [My Abandonware](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/sentimental-shooting-3t8), but be careful of viruses and malware.

The game's graphics are colorful and pixelated, reminiscent of the 16-bit era. The music is catchy and upbeat, with some vocal tracks in Japanese. The sound effects are also well-done, with realistic gunshots and explosions. The game's controls are simple and responsive, using the keyboard and mouse. You can also customize the game's settings, such as the screen size, the difficulty level, and the censorship option.
 
The game's story is humorous and lighthearted, with some references to anime and manga culture. The protagonist is a high school student who has a crush on his childhood friend, Yuki. One day, he receives a mysterious email from her, asking him to meet her at a certain place. However, when he arrives there, he finds out that she has been kidnapped by an evil organization called Echelon, who plans to use her as a test subject for their mind control device. The protagonist decides to infiltrate Echelon's base and rescue Yuki, using a special gun that can strip the clothes off anyone it hits.
 
The game's characters are diverse and attractive, each with their own personality and backstory. The female enemies are members of Echelon, who have been brainwashed by the mind control device. They range from schoolgirls to nurses to maids to ninjas, and they will try to stop the protagonist with their own weapons and abilities. The protagonist can also interact with some of them in dialogue scenes, where he can choose different responses that affect the outcome of the game.
  
Sentimental Shooting is a game that combines the genres of shoot 'em up and dating sim, with a dose of comedy and fanservice. It is a game that appeals to a niche audience, but it also offers a solid gameplay experience and a charming story. If you are looking for a game that is different from the mainstream, you might want to give Sentimental Shooting a try. Just make sure you are over 18 and you have a sense of humor.
