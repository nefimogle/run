## Some Tips and Tricks for Playing Frontschweine
 
Frontschweine is not only a funny game, but also a challenging one. You will need to use your wits and skills to defeat your enemies and complete your objectives. Here are some tips and tricks that may help you in your piggy war:

- Use the terrain to your advantage. The islands of Saustralasia are full of hills, cliffs, bridges, buildings, and other features that can affect your gameplay. You can use them to hide from enemy fire, gain height advantage, or create obstacles for your foes. You can also destroy some of them with your weapons to create new paths or traps.
- Choose your team wisely. Each team has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as different weapons and abilities. For example, the Tommy's Trotters team has more health and accuracy, but less speed and range. The Garlic Grunts team has more speed and range, but less health and accuracy. You should choose a team that suits your playstyle and strategy.
- Upgrade your pigs. As you progress through the game, you will earn promotion points that you can use to upgrade your pigs. You can increase their rank, health, speed, accuracy, or special skills. You can also unlock new weapons and abilities for them. Upgrading your pigs will make them more powerful and versatile in combat.
- Experiment with different weapons and abilities. Frontschweine has a variety of weapons and abilities that you can use to attack or defend yourself. Some of them are more effective than others depending on the situation. For example, the bazooka is good for long-range attacks, but not for close combat. The jetpack is good for flying over obstacles, but not for stealth. You should try out different weapons and abilities to find out what works best for you.
- Have fun! Frontschweine is a game that does not take itself too seriously. It is full of humor, jokes, references, and parodies that will make you laugh and enjoy yourself. You can also customize your pigs with different names, voices, hats, and medals. You can also play with your friends in multiplayer mode or create your own maps with the map editor.
