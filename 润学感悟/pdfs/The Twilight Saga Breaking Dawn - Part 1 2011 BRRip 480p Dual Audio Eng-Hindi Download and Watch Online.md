## Step 2: Create Bootable Rescue Media
 
The first thing you should do after installing Macrium Reflect 7 is to create bootable rescue media. This is a CD, DVD, or USB drive that contains a copy of Macrium Reflect 7 and can be used to boot your computer and restore your data if your operating system fails to start. To create bootable rescue media, click on the "Create bootable Rescue media" icon on the main screen of Macrium Reflect 7 and follow the wizard[^2^]. You should keep this media in a safe place and update it whenever you update Macrium Reflect 7.
  
## Step 3: Backup Your Data
 
Macrium Reflect 7 offers two types of backup: disk imaging and file and folder backup. Disk imaging creates a complete copy of your entire disk or partition, including the operating system, applications, settings, and data. File and folder backup allows you to select specific files or folders to backup. You can choose either type of backup depending on your needs and preferences.
 
To create a disk image, select the disk or partition you want to backup from the "Create a Backup" screen and click on "Image this disk". To create a file and folder backup, click on "Backup Files and Folders" on the main screen and select the files or folders you want to backup. You can also customize various options for your backup, such as compression level, encryption, password protection, etc. You can also schedule your backups to run automatically at regular intervals or on specific events[^3^].
 
Macrium Reflect 7 also supports differential and incremental backups, which only backup the changes since the last full or previous backup. This can save time and disk space. You can also use retention rules to manage how long you want to keep your backups and delete old ones automatically[^3^].
  
## Step 4: Restore Your Data
 
If you need to restore your data from a backup, Macrium Reflect 7 makes it easy and fast. You can restore your data from within Windows or from the bootable rescue media. To restore from within Windows, open Macrium Reflect 7 and select the backup file you want to restore from. You can then choose to restore the entire disk image or specific files or folders. You can also restore to a different location or a different disk if you want.
 
To restore from the bootable rescue media, insert the media into your computer and boot from it. You will see a similar interface as Macrium Reflect 7 in Windows. You can then browse for your backup file on your local drive or an external drive and restore it as described above.
 
If you need to restore your operating system to a different hardware configuration, you can use Macrium ReDeploy, which is included in some editions of Macrium Reflect 7. This feature allows you to adjust the drivers and settings of your restored system to match the new hardware.
  
## Conclusion
 
Macrium Reflect 7 is a reliable and user-friendly backup and recovery software that can help you protect your data from various threats and scenarios.
